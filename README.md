## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

FFinally I understand the Flex property, I strugel las nigth for hours! whit the CSS.
The `media querys` was easy once I domine the `Flex-box`.
I'm sure that is not the best solution, regarded to the responsive solution, but I hope to learn from the feedback.
